SMB signing allows the recipient of SMB packets to confirm their authenticity and helps prevent man in the middle attacks against SMB. SMB 2.x signing can be configured in one of two ways: not required (least secure) and required (most secure).","* Microsoft Windows
      Configure SMB signing for Windows

      
       Configure the system to enable or require SMB signing as appropriate. The method and effect of doing this is system specific so please see  this TechNet article (http://blogs.technet.com/b/josebda/archive/2010/12/01/the-basics-of-smb-signing-covering-both-smb1-and-smb2.aspx)  for details. Note: ensure that SMB signing configuration is done for incoming connections (Server). 



 * Samba
      Configure SMB signing for Samba

      
       Configure Samba to enable or require SMB signing as appropriate. To enable SMB signing, put the following in the Samba configuration file, typically smb.conf, in the global section: 
       server signing = auto 
 To require SMB signing, put the following in the Samba configuration file, typically smb.conf, in the global section: 
       server signing = mandatory",

It is recommended to limit direct access to trusted systems because databases may contain sensitive data, and new vulnerabilities and exploits are discovered routinely for them. For this reason, it is a violation of PCI DSS section 1.3.6 to have databases listening on ports accessible from the Internet, even when protected with secure authentication mechanisms.","Restrict database access


 Configure the database server to only allow access to trusted systems. For example, the PCI DSS standard requires you to place the database in an internal network zone, segregated from the DMZ",

An M-SEARCH response is roughly 30x the size of the request and can be distributed across multiple responses from multiple hosts, and because it utilizes UDP, this can be used to conduct traffic amplification attacks against other assets, typically in the form of distributed reflected denial of service (DRDoS) attacks.","Restrict access to UPnP

 Restrict access to the UPnP service to only trusted assets.",CERT:TA14-017A
